# FillingintheGaps.py

**Code Analysis: Filling in the Gaps**

**Overview**

This Python script searches for files in a specified folder that start with a given prefix (`'spam'`) and attempts to extract a numerical sequence from their names. It then identifies gaps in the sequence and prints them.

**Breakdown**

1. **Importing Libraries**

The script imports the following libraries:
	* `os` for interacting with the operating system (e.g., listing files in a directory)
	* `re` (not used in this code snippet)
	* `pathlib` for working with file paths
	* `pyinputplus` for user input (specifically, `pyip.inputStr` for getting a string input from the user)

2. **User Input**

The script prompts the user to enter the absolute path of the folder to search. This path is stored in the `searched_folder` variable.

3. **Initialization**

The script initializes two variables:
	* `last
